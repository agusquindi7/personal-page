Hi, my name is Agustin Quindimil. I’m a junior game developer from Argentina, focused on C# programming in Unity.

2
00:07,00 --> 00:14,00
I’ve worked on several projects, including a 3D stealth and parkour game, a mobile fighting game,

3
00:14,00 --> 00:22,00
and a stock management app using Python and SQL. These helped me build experience with gameplay programming, AI, and backend logic.

4
00:22,00 --> 00:27,00
Right now, I’m working on my thesis with a group from my university.

5
00:27,00 --> 00:31,00
We're developing a realistic adventure game with Souls-like elements.

6
00:31,00 --> 00:35,00
I’m contributing to both the gameplay systems and overall design.

7
00:35,00 --> 00:41,00
At the same time, I’m taking a Front-End Development course with JavaScript through a government program,

8
00:41,00 --> 00:46,00
and I recently paused a Cybersecurity course to focus fully on finishing my degree.

9
00:46,00 --> 00:49,00
I’m fluent in English and a native Spanish speaker.

10
00:49,00 --> 00:53,00
I love combining creativity with code and I’m always open to opportunities where I can grow and bring value to a development team.
